# ChessAI
University Exam Project

A **Python** project that uses **OOP, Functional and Multi Threading** to calculate the best moves to beat the player at chess.

The algorithm implemented is a **mini-max**, that uses weights for each piece to calculate which is the best move.

There is also a minimal GUI in order to play against the AI.
